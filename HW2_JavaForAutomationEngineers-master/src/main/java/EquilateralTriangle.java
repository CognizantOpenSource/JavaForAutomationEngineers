// TODO FOR HOMEWORK: Write the entire Equilateral Triangle Class
//    NOTE: We will be expecting a correct Triangle class even though we aren't spelling out what to do.
//          Use all the information within the project and your knowledge base.
//          Feel free to get fancy and explore here, as long as you have the basics we won't discount anything extra
//          you might get wrong.
//    NOTE: An EquilateralTriangle has the same base for all 3 sides, and the height is always (sqrt(3)/2) * the base.
//          So the important thing to note is you will only need the base and you can calculate the height
public class EquilateralTriangle {
    /**
     * Creates an instance of the Triangle class
     * NOTE: Do not touch this method!

    public EquilateralTriangle() {
